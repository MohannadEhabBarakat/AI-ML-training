# What is this?
During my AI learning journey, I have been testing different solutions, algorithms, and architectures. In this repo, I have included most of my work. If it was a fork of other repo I have included its link below. 

<b>*Note: list of forked repos might not be up to date*</b>

## List of functions 
- [Cross Entropy](Cross%20Entropy)
- [Softmax](Softmax)
- [Perceptron Algorithm](Perceptron%20Algorithm) 

## list of projects and problems
- MNIST handwritten numbers with MLT neural networks. (final touches )
- MNISTfashion with MLT neural networks.
- MNIST handwritten numbers with CNNs.
- Music generation with CNNs
- [Student Admission](student-admissions) - Given a list of exam scores expect weather student would be accepted or not

## list of nice courses I learned from
- Udacity nanodegree (I had access to a couple of them from my friends)
- [MIT Introduction to Deep Learning 6.S191](http://introtodeeplearning.com/)
